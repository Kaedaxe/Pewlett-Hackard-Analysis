## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
A total of ~72,500 roles will be vacated as the "silver tsunami" takes effect. A majority of these roles are senior staff and engineers, representing a great loss to the overall experience and leadership of the company's employee base.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Only ~1550 employees are considered eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This is significantly fewer than needed to properly train the eventual replacements of the many soon-to-be-vacant roles.
