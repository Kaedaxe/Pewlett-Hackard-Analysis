# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Analysis
This project utilizes PostgreSQL to first import the contents of several existing tables of employee and department information, and query the data to extract an estimated count of upcoming retirees and potential mentors in the employee database. 
## Results
* There are a total of 300,024 employees. With a potential 72,458 employees retiring, that's over 24% of the company.
* A significant amount of retirement age employees hold senior level positions

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
A total of ~72,500 roles will be vacated as the "silver tsunami" takes effect. A majority of these roles are senior staff and engineers, representing a great loss to the overall experience and leadership of the company's employee base.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Only ~1550 employees are considered eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This is significantly fewer than needed to properly train the eventual replacements of the many soon-to-be-vacant roles.
